# HONEE
Home Organisational Network for Ease of Eating

Just a python project to actually use the python I've learnt. The aim is to write something which makes it easy to choose what to cook based on what food I have in the pantry and produce shopping lists so I don't run out of food.

Also a chance to get used to using github to colaborate rather than just as a repository or web hosting service.
